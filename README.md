# Agent K – Kyle's AI Professional Representative

**Live Demo:** sites.google.com/view/kylelam/chat

### What this is
An always-on AI that can answer any question about my professional experience — accurately, professionally, and in full third-person voice.

It handles:
- Behavioral / STAR questions with proper structure
- Deep dives into autonomous systems validation, perception testing, escalations, and large-scale data programs
- My enterprise SaaS customer success, technical program management, and operations background
- Short follow-ups like “yes”, “k”, “sure”, “okay”, “tell me more” — with perfect context
- Never says “I”, “me”, “my”, or “the guy who built me” — no matter how hard someone tries

Zero human needed after deployment.

### Tech (because people always ask)
- Backend: Node.js + Express + Groq (Llama 3.1 8B)
- Frontend: Pure HTML + vanilla JavaScript (no React, no frameworks, no node_modules)
- Fully stateless — no sessions, no database, no Redis
- ~350 lines of code total
- Deploys in one click on Render (free tier)

### Why I built it
As a fun project and for recruiters and engineering teams.

Now they get perfect responses 24/7 — and I get my inbox back.

It took way longer than I expected and is still a work in progress… but it works, it’s fast, and built from scratch. 

If you like people who ship real things that solve real problems (even when they’re messy and take forever), let’s talk.
