Agent K – Kyle’s Personal AI Representative
Live demo: https://sites.google.com/view/kylelam/chat
What it actually is
A fully autonomous AI that can take the first 5–10 rounds of any recruiter or technical conversation about me.
It knows my entire background cold, answers in perfect third-person, handles follow-ups like “yes”, “k”, “sure”, “tell me more”, and never once says “I” or “the guy who built me”.
I built it because I got tired of typing the same 20 answers over and over.
Features that matter

Answers behavioral questions with proper STAR stories
Explains autonomous systems work, perception testing, escalations, data programs, TPM experience, enterprise customer success — whatever you ask
Works flawlessly on phone and desktop
Sub-second responses
No sessions, no database, no frameworks, no bloat

Total code: ~350 lines across two files.
Deployed in one click.
Why this is here
If you’re a recruiter: feel free to grill Agent K for as long as you want.
If you’re an engineer: poke the code, try to break it, see how stupidly small it is for what it does.
Either way, when you’re done, just shoot me a message.
I build things that save time, ship fast, and actually work — and I’m looking for the next place where that’s useful.
