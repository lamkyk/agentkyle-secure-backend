# Agent K – Kyle's AI Professional Representative

**Live Demo:** [sites.google.com/view/kylelam/chat](https://sites.google.com/view/kylelam/chat)

### What this is
An always-on AI that can answer any question about my professional experience — accurately, professionally, and in full third-person voice.

What it doesn't tell:
- It's my first coding project; took hundreds of hours, dozens of failed versions, countless redeploys, and way too many late-night debugging sessions. 
- Rebuilt from scratch at least 4 times.
- I’ve broken production at 2 a.m. 
- Watched the bot say “I’m Kyle” 47 different ways 
- Fought Render cold starts, wrestled with LLM rate limits, rewritten the context-carryover logic 9 times, and redeployed more than 120 times.
- These lines of code you see is the survivor of trial, error, rage-quits, and “why won’t this just work” moments.

It handles:
- Behavioral / STAR questions with proper structure
- Deep dives into autonomous systems validation, perception testing, escalations, and large-scale data programs
- My enterprise SaaS customer success, technical program management, and operations background
- Short follow-ups like “yes”, “k”, “sure”, “okay”, “tell me more” — with perfect context
- Never says “I”, “me”, “my”, or “the guy who built me” — no matter how hard someone tries

Zero human needed after deployment.

### Tech (because people always ask)
- Backend: Node.js + Express + Groq (Llama 3.1 8B)
- Frontend: Pure HTML + vanilla JavaScript (no React, no frameworks, no node_modules)
- Fully stateless — no sessions, no database, no Redis
- ~3000+ lines of code total
- Deploys in one click

### Why I built it
As a fun project and for recruiters and engineering teams.

Now they get perfect responses 24/7 — and I get my inbox back.

It took way longer than I expected and is still a work in progress… but it works, it’s fast, and built from scratch. 

If you like people who ship real things that solve real problems (even when they’re messy and take forever), let’s talk.
